## Virtual Reality Headset Simulator
A SteamVR driver to simulate a physical Virtual Reality Headset & Controllers without the need for a physical headset

The driver reads from a local file for all of its inputs. 
A Node.js webapp is included to be used as an interface for editing this file automatically via a primitive mockup of the headset and controls.
